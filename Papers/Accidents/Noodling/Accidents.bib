@article{Haglich2010,
	Abstract = {As social networks expand and interconnect with other social networks, their combined behavior can become more complex than each individual network in isolation and can result in unexpected self-organizing or emergent behaviors. This emergent behavior results from the combined knowledge or skills of the participants, and it enables the group to do things that it could not otherwise accomplish. Examples of such social network emergence can be found in startup companies, charitable organizations, groups of researchers and terrorist cells. This paper discusses a mathematical modeling technique for prediction and detection of emergent behavior in social networks using Semi-Boolean Algebra. This paper discusses emergent behavior, the use of Semi-Boolean Algebra for detecting it, and gives examples of its use on emergence in an example social network.},

@article{Winner1980,
	Abstract = {In controversies about technology and society, there is no idea more pro vocative than the notion that technical things have political qualities. At issue is the claim that the machines, structures, and systems of modern material culture can be accurately judged not only for their contributions of efficiency and pro ductivity, not merely for their positive and negative environmental side effects, but also for the ways in which they can embody specific forms of power and authority. Since ideas of this kind have a persistent and troubling presence in discussions about the meaning of technology, they deserve explicit attention.1 Writing in Technology and Culture almost two decades ago, Lewis Mumford gave classic statement to one version of the theme, arguing that "from late neo lithic times in the Near East, right down to our own day, two technologies have recurrently existed side by side: one authoritarian, the other democratic, the first system-centered, immensely powerful, but inherently unstable, the other man-centered, relatively weak, but resourceful and durable."2 This thesis stands at the heart of Mumford's studies of the city, architecture, and the his tory of technics, and mirrors concerns voiced earlier in the works of Peter Kropotkin, William Morris, and other nineteenth century critics of industrial ism. More recently, antinuclear and prosolar energy movements in Europe and America have adopted a similar notion as a centerpiece in their arguments. Thus environmentalist Denis Hayes concludes, "The increased deployment of nuclear power facilities must lead society toward authoritarianism. Indeed, safe reliance upon nuclear power as the principal source of energy may be possible only in a totalitarian state." Echoing the views of many proponents of appropri ate technology and the soft energy path, Hayes contends that "dispersed solar sources are more compatible than centralized technologies with social equity, freedom and cultural pluralism."3 An eagerness to interpret technical artifacts in political language is by no means the exclusive property of critics of large-scale high-technology systems. A long lineage of boosters have insisted that the "biggest and best" that science and industry made available were the best guarantees of democracy, freedom, and social justice. The factory system, automobile, telephone, radio, television, the space program, and of course nuclear power itself have all at one time or another been described as democratizing, liberating forces.

@article{Crawford2016,
	Abstract = {This paper explores how political theory may help us map algorithmic logics against different visions of the political. Drawing on Chantal Mouffe's theories of agonistic pluralism, this paper depicts algorithms in public life in ten distinct scenes, in order to ask the question: what kinds of politics do they instantiate? Algorithms are working within highly contested online spaces of public discourse, such as YouTube and Facebook, where incompatible perspectives coexist. Yet algorithms are designed to produce clear " winners " from information contests, often with little visibility or accountability for how those contests are designed. In isolation, many of these algorithms seem the opposite of agonistic: much of the complexity of search, ranking and recommendation algorithms is non-negotiable and kept far from view, inside an algorithmic " black box " . But what if we widen our perspective? This paper suggests agonistic pluralism as both a design ideal for engineers, as well as a provocation to understand algorithms in a broader social context: rather than focusing on the calculations in isolation, we need to account for the spaces of contestation where they operate.},
